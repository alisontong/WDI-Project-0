Creating a miniblog website. Project 0 for WDI Week 2. Kanban board and user narrative written on <a href="https://trello.com/b/YAroX3dk/wdi-project-0">my Trello</a>.
<br><br>
My overall idea is to have this be a blogging website targeted for Steam Early Access game developers and players. Game developers can post miniblogs regarding their new games, link to their private alpha- and beta-testing games on Steam, and receive comments from the players regarding advice and debugging suggestions. Ideally, <b>each comment from a player will have an overall rating for that game</b>. This will bring smaller game developers and players closer together.
<br><br>
Still do to: Add comment buttons will only add comments to the bottom of the comments line; not the post you clicked on the "add comment" button. Also, comment text string isn't adding for some reason.
<br><br>
Once project is completed, I will still need to store posts, comments, and average ratings in a backend server. After that, display average ratings both per game and per developer profile.  Add developer profile page and player profile page.
